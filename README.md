# burger
This application lets you enter the names of burgers that you would like to eat. The burger names are displayed in one of two lists. One list is for burgers which have not yet been devoured, and the other list is for burgers which have been devoured. Each burger in the first list(not yet divoured) has a Devour button next to it , which can be clicked to devour the burger and move it to the other list. Node.js and Express is used for the server side part of the application. MySQL is used for the database, to store burger information. Handlebars is used as a templating engine to simplify the process of injecting data from JavaScript into the HTML. A custom  ORM (Object-relational Mapper) is used to query the database.
